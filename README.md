# handUI
interface designs and prototyping tools for hands

This repo contains examples of UI design for tracked hands in AR/VR featuring remote interaction, and some general components that I use for rapid prototyping. 

HandUI sits on top of Leap Motionâ€™s API, although it should be adaptable for other tracking and input systems.
